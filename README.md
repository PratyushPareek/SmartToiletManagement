# SmartToiletManagement
This project was assigned to us. We are not weird. Please don't judge me, I'm overly self-conscious.

This is a Java swing application designed and developed on the NetBeans IDE as part of our OOM Miniproject. 

This application is to be used to monitor a set of smart toilets with gas and turbidity sensors, that can be automated (with the help of this application to send alerts to Janitors with the details. 
The application can be used as an interface to this system by the admin of cleanliness for:
-Adding/Deleting Janitors
-Updating contact info of the Janitors
-Managing thresholds for the sensors
-Checking on the status of the Toilets
-Checking on the status of teh Janitors
